# [1-2] Basic 3D Snow Globe Implementation

## Description
Create the foundational 3D scene using Three.js, implementing the basic snow globe geometry with realistic glass material and a decorative base. This task focuses on setting up the core 3D rendering components without the snow particles or interactive features.

## Requirements
1. Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
2. Create snow globe geometry with realistic glass material
3. Implement decorative base with proper materials
4. Add appropriate lighting setup
5. Configure proper camera positioning and controls
6. Implement basic scene animation loop
7. Ensure proper scaling and responsiveness
8. Set up proper scene cleanup on component unmount

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Scene Setup
- Initialize Three.js scene
- Set up perspective camera with appropriate parameters
- Configure WebGLRenderer with proper settings
- Implement OrbitControls for development purposes
- Add ambient and directional lighting
- Set up scene resize handler

### 2. Snow Globe Creation
- Create sphere geometry for the globe
- Implement realistic glass material using Three.js materials
- Add subtle environment mapping for reflections
- Create proper UV mapping for future texture use
- Add subtle distortion effect for glass realism

### 3. Base Implementation
- Design and create decorative base geometry
- Implement materials for metallic/wooden appearance
- Add subtle engravings or details
- Ensure proper connection with the glass sphere

### 4. Optimization & Cleanup
- Implement proper disposal of Three.js objects
- Set up memory management best practices
- Ensure smooth rendering performance
- Add proper error handling

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify the basic 3D snow globe implementation works correctly with proper materials, lighting, and performance.

### Test Scope
- Scene initialization and setup
- Material rendering and appearance
- Lighting and shadows
- Performance and memory usage
- Responsive behavior
- Cleanup functionality

### Environment & Setup
- Modern browser with WebGL support
- Various screen sizes for responsive testing
- Development tools for performance monitoring

### Key Test Scenarios

1. Scene Initialization
   - Scene loads without errors
   - All components render correctly
   - Camera position provides good view of globe

2. Material Rendering
   - Glass material shows proper transparency
   - Base material appears realistic
   - Reflections and refractions work correctly

3. Lighting
   - Ambient light provides base illumination
   - Directional light creates proper shadows
   - Materials react correctly to lighting

4. Performance
   - Maintains 60fps during normal operation
   - No memory leaks during extended use
   - Proper cleanup on scene disposal

5. Responsiveness
   - Adapts to window resize events
   - Maintains aspect ratio
   - Proper scaling on different devices

### Success Criteria
- Scene renders without visual artifacts
- Materials appear realistic
- Lighting creates proper atmosphere
- Performance meets target metrics
- Responsive behavior works correctly
- Memory usage remains stable
