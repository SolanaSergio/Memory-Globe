# PBI-1: Digital Snow Globe Web Application

## Overview
Create an immersive and romantic digital snow globe web application that displays cherished memories (photos/videos) when shaken through various interaction methods. The application aims to create a magical and personal experience for users to relive their special moments.

## Problem Statement
Users want a unique and engaging way to view and interact with their cherished memories. Traditional photo albums and digital galleries lack the emotional and interactive elements that make revisiting memories special. A digital snow globe combines nostalgia, interactivity, and modern technology to create a more meaningful experience.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to upload my photos and videos to the snow globe, so I can see them displayed inside
- As a user, I want to shake the snow globe using my mouse or device, so I can trigger the snow effect and memory transitions
- As a user, I want to customize the snow globe's appearance, so it matches my personal style
- As a user, I want sound effects and haptic feedback, so the experience feels more immersive
- As a user, I want the application to work smoothly on all my devices, so I can access my memories anywhere

## Technical Approach
The application will be built using modern web technologies:
- Three.js for 3D rendering and physics
- HTML5 Canvas + WebGL for high-performance graphics
- JavaScript ES6+ for application logic
- Web APIs for device interaction and media handling
- Responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility

### Core Components:
1. 3D Snow Globe Renderer
   - Glass sphere with realistic materials
   - Wooden/metallic base with engravings
   - Dynamic lighting and reflections

2. Particle System
   - Physics-based snow simulation
   - Response to shake intensity
   - Optimized performance

3. Memory Display System
   - Media loading and management
   - Smooth transitions
   - Intelligent scaling

4. Interaction Handler
   - Mouse/touch input
   - Device motion detection
   - Keyboard controls

5. Customization System
   - Theme management
   - Particle customization
   - Sound settings

## UX/UI Considerations
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for media upload
- Clear visual feedback for shake interactions
- Accessible controls for all interaction methods
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clear customization options

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 3D Rendering
   - Snow globe renders with realistic glass material
   - Base displays with proper material and engravings
   - Lighting creates appropriate ambiance
   - Reflections and refractions work correctly

2. Particle System
   - Snow falls naturally with gravity
   - Particles respond to shake intensity
   - Performance maintains 60fps on modern devices
   - Different particle types available

3. Memory Display
   - Supports photos and videos
   - Proper scaling within globe
   - Smooth transitions between memories
   - Maintains media quality

4. Interaction
   - Mouse drag works for shaking
   - Device motion detection functions
   - Keyboard controls work
   - Haptic feedback on supported devices

5. Customization
   - Snow color/type selection works
   - Base material/text customization
   - Theme selection functions
   - Sound/music controls work

6. Performance
   - Loads quickly on all devices
   - Maintains smooth animation
   - Handles memory efficiently
   - Responsive to all screen sizes

## Dependencies
- Three.js library
- Web Audio API support
- Device Orientation API support
- Modern browser with WebGL support

## Open Questions
1. Should we support offline mode via PWA?
2. What are the maximum file sizes for media uploads?
3. Should we implement cloud storage for memories?
4. What level of social sharing features should be included?
