# [1-4] Memory Display System

## Description
Create a system for loading and displaying photos inside the snow globe. This includes implementing image loading, texture mapping, and proper positioning within the globe's 3D space. The system should handle multiple images and prepare for transitions between them.

## Requirements
1. Set up image loading system for provided JPEG files
2. Create texture mapping system for displaying images in 3D space
3. Implement proper image positioning within the snow globe
4. Handle multiple images in a collection
5. Ensure proper memory management for loaded textures
6. Add error handling for image loading failures
7. Implement proper cleanup on image changes
8. Support different image aspect ratios
9. Optimize image loading and display performance

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Image Loading System
- Create utility for loading image files
- Convert images to Three.js textures
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading state management
- Set up image collection management

### 2. Display System
- Create geometry for image display
- Implement material with proper texture mapping
- Position images correctly within globe space
- Handle different aspect ratios
- Add proper scaling and orientation

### 3. Memory Management
- Implement texture disposal
- Cache frequently used images
- Handle cleanup during transitions
- Monitor memory usage

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Implement image preloading
- Add texture size optimization
- Handle loading states gracefully
- Implement proper error states

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify that images load correctly and display properly within the snow globe environment.

### Test Scope
- Image loading functionality
- Texture creation and mapping
- Memory management
- Error handling
- Performance metrics

### Environment & Setup
- Test environment with sample images
- Various image sizes and formats
- Memory monitoring tools

### Key Test Scenarios

1. Image Loading
   - Successfully loads provided JPEG files
   - Handles loading errors gracefully
   - Manages multiple images efficiently

2. Display Quality
   - Images appear clear and properly positioned
   - Aspect ratios are maintained
   - No visual artifacts or distortions

3. Memory Management
   - Proper cleanup of unused textures
   - No memory leaks during image switches
   - Efficient resource usage

4. Performance
   - Smooth loading transitions
   - Stable frame rate during display
   - Efficient memory usage

### Success Criteria
- All test images load successfully
- Images display clearly within globe
- Memory usage remains stable
- Performance meets target metrics
- Error handling works as expected
